# Greek Yogurt Turf Analysis

The project is to support decisions related to the set of flavors to launch for the next Greek Yogurt. The VP over this project has requested that we should provide information for the decision. The goal of the information is to understand how much customers like each flavor in order to understand which flavors to launch for the private label.<br>
The private label recently launched six flavors--Blueberry, Honey, Peach, Plain, Strawberry, and Vanilla. We should focus on providing analytics to help determine what the next flavors to launch should be.<br>
The data I have are survey data that captures information about consumers’ flavor preferences.<br>
During conversations with the VP and private brand manager, the analytics goals have become clearer. In particular, the VP laid out that our team will deliver analyses related to the following loose analysis design.<br>
1. Describe the percentage of sales of existing flavors in the Greek yogurt category (all brands)<br> 
2. Describe the percentage of sales of existing yogurt flavors outside of Greek yogurt (regular class of yogurt)<br> 
3. Describe survey respondents’ preferences for Greek yogurt flavors.<br> 
4. Predict the best set of next flavors to add to achieve the highest reach using the survey data.<br>
